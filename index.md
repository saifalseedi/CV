12/2021 to Present, Assistant Chief Engineer, Head of IT department, Shiite Endowment Diwan, Babylon, Iraq.
I Am responsible for five different units under my supervision, and each unit has a team of 3 to 5 members of staff. These units are the support/tech unit, IT management unit, IT maintenance unit, network/system unit, and IT security unit. My department is responsible for all computers and machines like scanners, photocopiers, printers, and CCTV from installation, maintenance, and training. My significant performance was restructuring the department staff and the objective. I built an enterprise-level software solution to automate repetitive tasks, manage fundamental processing, handle process logic, and use this system in my directory.
[ 5 months]

12/2019 to 12/2021, Project Manager Engineer of E-Government, Shiite Endowment Diwan, Baghdad, Iraq.
The project E-Government was assigned to me as a chair of the E-Government committee; this project has four different contracts for four states (Baghdad, Karbala, Babylon, and Najaf). I started by contacting and meeting companies to purchase devices. When all devices were purchased, I began gathering a team to install, set up the software, and establish an intranet network between states. I connected four states with one network as an Intranet using towers and wireless dishes and tested the communication devices. The results were a VoIP service, web-based Internet applications like employee cards, document management, a biometric attendance management system, CCTV, and a training platform.
[ 24 months]

12/2017 to 12/2019, Project Manager Engineer, Shiite Endowment Diwan, Babylon, Iraq.
At the end of 2017, I was appointed as a Project Manager Engineer for a large-scale project with 175,000 m2. This project consists of multi-store buildings, an Amusement park, a generation plant, and a distribution HV and LV substation. My staff consists of different engineering fields like (Artichecture, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Material, Survey, and Transportation engineering) as a supervisor and team leader, we work hard to accomplish this project. The total investment in this project is about 20 million $. 
[ 24 months]

05/2017 to 12/2017, PCB Design Engineer, AL BADER ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES, Babylon, Iraq.
As part of my work with Al Bader Electronic Industries Company, I designed and prototyped an Industrial Cloud Monitoring System based on IoT. This system is used in industrial factories. The advantage of the system is that it can be used for different types of machines and operating systems. And another project, I designed and prototyped an IoT Management Solution for Fill Level Monitoring for Gravel Silos. The idea of this project is to reduce the cost and use the cloud with Google Maps to locate the silos and the fill levels of these silos.
[ 7 months]

10/2016 to 05/2017 – University of Technology,  As part of laboratory experiments and working for a master's degree, I create a modelling algorithm using Matlab to enhance the roughing and finishing time and generate a G-code for a 3-axis CNC machine. This algorithm is easy for postgraduate students to mill models or prototypes. While I was doing the experiments and creating parts using a CNC machine, I noticed that the transfer of g-code and controlling the machine was done manually, and this took time and effort to make parts, so I developed and prototyped a wireless controller for a CNC machine. This controller was installed on the 3-axis CNC machines at the university CNC workshop to connect machines with the central computer to show all processes of the machines. 
After that, my supervisor gave me an opportunity to visit and work in Melbourne University/Australia lab, and I designed and prototyped a Microstrip Grid Antenna Array. This work was published in the journal of communications.
